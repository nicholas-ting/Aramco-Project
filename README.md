# Aramco-Project
<b>NTU Analytics 1 Project  

This project is a Proof Of Concept Project done for Analytics Module in NTU, seeking to examine and determine significant causes of pipeline accidents as well as provide predictive models that allow Aramco to detect early signs of identified causes that pose safety concerns. 
These models seek to help Aramco reduce unnecessary safety hazards and resource loss brought about by delayed responses to identified causes.
Analysis of these models allow us to better formulate and suggest business solutions to Aramco to deal with safety concerns.
